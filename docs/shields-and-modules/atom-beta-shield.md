# Atom Beta Shield

The second generation of the Helium Development Shield is known as the **Atom**. The Atom, pictured here, is what beta participants are using for their development on the Helium network.

The Atoms are made to pin into the [Arduino UNO](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno), pictured below. (Atoms will work with various other MCUs that are Arduino-compatible, but the UNO provides seamless integration with the Atom's pinout. Other boards like the Intel Galileo and Arduino Mega will require jumper wires for integration.)

## Atom Schematic and Pins

You can find a full schematic for the Atom [here](/assets/Springer_Rev2_0_SCH.pdf) (PDF). This should aid you when integrating with the various available pins on the Atom.
