# Helium Documentation  


Welcome to the Helium Documentation. Here you will find all the information needed to make use of the wondrous hardware, software, and platform we've built. Much like Helium itself, the documentation and resources provided should be considered beta. Please be patient as we refine and expand things. 

If you're new to Helium and are part of the Beta, head over the [Fusion documenation]() to get started.
