# Element Beta Bridge

Helium Bridges create local connectivity for your devices and other devices in range. The beta bridge is known as an Element. Elements are deployed in two simple steps: connecting it to a power source; and turning it on. 

### Plugging In the Element 

The Element uses a 5V USB Charger to power the onboard LiPo battery.  To plug in your Element, connect the USB Typa A end of the provided power cable into the USB charger, and plug the unit into an outlet. The other end of the power cable, the USB Type B connection, plugs into bottom of the Element. 

When this is complete, you should see the LEDs on the front of the Element illuminate, indicating that the Element is now receiving power. 


### Connecting the Element 

After plugging in your Element, you'll need to turn it on. This is done via the toggle switch that's exposed when you open the Element's case. 

Immediatley after being powered on, the Blue LED located on the front of the board will go solid, indicating that the Element is in the process of connecting. This should only take a few seconds. When this is complete, the LED will go off, and then proceed to blink once per second. Your Element is now connected. 

You are now ready to start building applications [with your Atom](/shields-and-modules/atom-beta-shield/). If you have any issues while deploying your Element, post a message on the [Forum](http://forum.helium.co/) or find us in [Helium Community Chat](http://www.hipchat.com/g0w30ttrl).
