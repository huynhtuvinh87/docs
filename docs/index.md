# Helium Documentation  


Welcome to the Helium Documentation. Here you will find all the information needed to make use of the wondrous hardware, software, and platform we've built. Much like Helium itself, the documentation and resources provided should be considered beta. Please be patient as we refine and expand things. 

If you're new to Helium and are part of the Beta, you have a few options to get started:

* Learn more about the [Atom](/docs/shields-and-modules/atom-beta-shield/), the beta development board.
* Start developing with [Helium Fusion](/docs/fusion/helium-fusion/).
* Deploy your [Helium Bridge](/docs/shields-and-modules/element-beta-bridge/).
